# Youtube_trending_videos_python_analysis

## Description and objective
This project focuses on data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights from the "Trending YouTube Video Statistics" data gotten from kaggle. The dataset was processed to handle missing values, date formatting, category mapping, and creation of new features such as publish hour, day of the week, and time-to-trend.

The main objectives of this project are to:
Prepare the YouTube datasets for analysis by handling inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues.
Engineer meaningful features to better understand video performance and trends.
Perform exploratory data analysis to identify insights such as:
Which categories receive the most views, likes, or comments
The effect of publishing hour or day on video engagement
The time it takes for videos to appear on trending
Ratio of likes to dislikes across categories
Visualize trends and patterns to facilitate understanding of YouTube audience behavior.
Provide a clean, structured dataset that can be used for further analysis, machine learning modeling, or reporting.
